# The Palindrome Saga

This small project helps us transition from an introductory programming course (like LUC's COMP 170) to a standard
 course on data structures (COMP 271).
 
 It demonstrates how a humble method can become a nightmare. Along the way, the project helps refresh skills
  with control
  flow (if statements and loops), void and return methods, and scanning operations on data across the internet.
  
Next, the project demonstrates the need for a data structure and "invents" one by running
 into a rigid aspect in many programming languages: arrays cannot be resized. After that, the project examines
  performance and  "invents" another data structure, more suitable to its needs.
