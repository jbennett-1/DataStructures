# CTA module

This module comprises three classes.

* [CTALine](CTALine.java): A class that links together a sequence of CTAStation objects to model a CTA train line.
* [CTAStation](CTAStation.java): A simple class to describe a CTA train station.
* [BrownLine](BrownLine.java): An implementation class specific to CTA's Brown Line.

These classes were derived during COMP 271's [lab session of 7/1/21](Lab.MD).
