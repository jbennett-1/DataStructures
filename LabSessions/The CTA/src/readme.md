# The CTA

The Chicago Transit Authority is the major mass transit operator for Chicago. Nearly half a billion passengers rely on CTA's trains and buses every year to get around. For all its complexity, the network of buses and trains can be conceptualized as sequences of locations forming routes. These locations are either bus stops or train stations. Some locations serve as both.
