# Final Grades
Grading is completed. Exam scores and tentative final grades are posted on Sakai.Bonus problems are shown as a separate item on Sakai's grade book. I will be turning final grades to the registrar tomorrow.

If you notice a grade discrepancy, please let me know immediately. Grade discrepancies include missing grades or any concerns about your grade in the final exam.

With an **A** or **B** you can move into more advanced programming courses, if you wish so. 

With a **C** you can pursue computing coursework, but you may have some catchup work to do. Work on the things that challenged you the most, to get comfortable with them.

If your final grade is a **D** and you want to pursue a computing major and a career in the field, I recommend that you discuss it with someone (an advisor, a mentor, etc). You can do anything you set your mind to, but you need some guidance how to make it work.
