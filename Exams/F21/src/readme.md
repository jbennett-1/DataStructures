# COMP 271 Fall 2021 Midterm Assessment


## Rules of the road

* This is a take-home exam. It is due Friday 10/22/21 at 8 PM. Submit through Sakai only.

* Each problem is worth up to 2 points: 0 if no viable solution is observed; 1 if an incomplete/partial but possibly viable solution is shown; 2 if a complete solution is present.

* The exam has 3 problems, listed from the most challenging to the least so.

* Show and narrate/explain/justify all derivations and assumptions. (Narrating/explaining/justifying is not the same as describing. Describing alone is not enough).
For example, if you try to solve $a=b^x$ and you write $\log{a} = x\log{b}$, stating that you are taking the logarithm of both sides, that's a description. Justification means to explain why this is possible: have you verified that both sides of the equation are always positive numbers (there is no such thing as the logarithm of a negative number)?

* Before submitting, check and double-check: does your work answer the question? If your answer includes computer code, test it. Ensure that it works as expected.

* You are welcome to send a draft of your work to Leo for a quick review and feedback. Email (subject must include *COMP 363*) or Teams-chat, only. Review requests within 6-7 hours of the deadline may not be considered.

* Student Hours have been extended. Please don't wait for an appointment if you have a pressing question. Use Email or Teams messaging to expedite things.

* Your final work can be in the form of a Colab notebook (will earn you a **1 bonus point),** or a PDF file with typed up material, or good, well-illuminated, in-focus, properly oriented, high resolution photos of your work. 

 * Copy your Colab notebook's shareable URL on Sakai. Make sure that the notebook is shareable with "anyone with the link". (Click Share on upper right, then Get Link, to adjust this setting). Do **not** upload a Colab notebook on Sakai: it will not be graded.

 * Upload PDF or images to Sakai. If you are submitting images of handwritten material make sure they are neat, clean, clear of shadows, in-focus, and properly oriented. Images that are difficult to read, or that require rotation, may not be graded.

 * You are welcome to use **Java** instead of Python, for any coding that you need to do.

* You are responsible for an on-time submission. Verify that Sakai has accepted your submission. Solutions will be published right after the deadline. No late work will be accepted after solutions are posted.

* Problem-level bonus points are awarded only if the main problem solution is correct (or correct-ish).

* Neatness matters, a lot. At this stage of your studies, **your work must reflect your knowledge and your professionalism.**
