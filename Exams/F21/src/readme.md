# COMP 271 Fall 2021 Midterm Assessment


## Rules of the road

* This is a take-home exam. It is due Friday 10/22/21 at 11:55 PM. Submit through Sakai only.

* Each problem is worth up to 2 points: 0 if no viable solution is observed; 1 if an incomplete/partial but possibly viable solution is shown; 2 if a complete solution is present.

* The exam has 3 problems, listed from the most challenging to the least so.

* Show and narrate/explain/justify all derivations and assumptions. (Narrating/explaining/justifying is not the same as describing. Describing alone is not enough).

* Before submitting, check and double-check: does your work answer the question? If your answer includes computer code, test it. Ensure that it works as expected.

* You are welcome to send a draft of your work to Leo for a quick review and feedback. Email (subject must include *COMP 271*) or Teams-chat, only. Review requests within 6-7 hours of the deadline may not be considered.

* Student Hours have been extended. Please don't wait for an appointment if you have a pressing question. Use Email or Teams messaging to expedite things.

* Your final work can be in the form of java files or text files as needed. 

 * Upload java and text files to Sakai. 

* You are responsible for an on-time submission. Verify that Sakai has accepted your submission. Solutions will be published right after the deadline. No late work will be accepted after solutions are posted.

* Problem-level bonus points are awarded only if the main problem solution is correct (or correct-ish).

* Neatness matters, a lot. At this stage of your studies, **your work must reflect your knowledge and your professionalism.** Code must look need and clean, easy to read, and well documented with comments. Code that doesn't compile will not be graded.

## Inheritance (Cleaning up someone else's mess)

You are assigned to work on a project and you discover the following three classes in it. Do you keep them all? Do you change them a bit? Why and how?

```java
public class MotorBoat {

   private int accomodatesPersons;
   private String hullNumber;
   private String name;
   private boolean diesel;
